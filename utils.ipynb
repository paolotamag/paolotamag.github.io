He always brought positive energy and made sure to efficiently communicate with me and others any issues, client feedback and more, always in a direct, precise and helpful way. Not to mention, he always had a moment, during public events or in our daily work life, to listen to feedback, questions, and report issues and positive experiences. Also, his ability to successfully lead many KNIME events is obvious when seeing the positive impact of those events and how much of a trusted figure Paolo is. I really believe that Paolo is a dedicated and strong team player, an efficient communicator and great at public relations. I will sincerely miss working with him!\",\n",

One of the most striking aspects of his professional skill set is his deep understanding of how companies can harness the power of data for strategic advantage. In addition, his knowledge of how to harness the power of low-code tools (especially KNIME) is second to none. But he is not afraid to combine this with his knowledge of pure Python when needed. His exceptional ability to demystify complex data science processes is what really sets Paolo apart. He has a unique talent for making these processes easily understandable to a broader audience, which is invaluable in collaborative and cross-functional environments. I sincerely look forward to the opportunity to work with Paolo again in the near future. He would be an asset to any team or project focused on data science and analytics with his blend of expertise, innovation, and communication skills. For any organization looking to leverage data science for business growth and efficiency, I highly recommend him.\",\n",
