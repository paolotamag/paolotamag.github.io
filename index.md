I am currently in the second year of my [master in Data Science](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) in Rome at Sapienza University and I will graduate in Fall 2017.
Last August 2016 I started a 3-months internship with Enrico Bertini, assistant professor at New York University, Tandon School of Engineering. 
My project was involving the development of a visual analytics tool able to display interactively machine
learning explanations. 
On February 2017 I published a paper about my project, which has been selected for the workshop [HILDA 2017](http://hilda.io/2017/).
My plans are to come back after my graduation in New York City to start my data scientist career.
