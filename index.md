<p>In October 2017 I graduated in my <a href="http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it">master in Data Science</a> in Rome at Sapienza University and my thesis is available <a href="1536242_tamagnini_master_thesis.pdf">here</a>. I was part of the first graduation in Italy for a Data Science degree. The ceremony had many guests from companies like Google, Unicredit and Eurostat (more info <a href="http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it/archivionotizie/data-science-first-graduation">here</a>). To celebrate this day I wrote with the other graduating students a <a href="journal.pdf">journal</a> with articles talking about our experiences in the last two years and about the development of our theses.</p>

<p>My thesis is related to a 3-months internship I started in August 2016 in the research team of <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io/">Enrico Bertini</a>, assistant professor at New York University, <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/">Tandon School of Engineering</a>. 
My project was involving the development of a visual analytics tool able to display interactively machine learning explanations. 
I published a paper about this <a href="http://nyuvis-web.poly.edu/projects/rivelo/">project</a> in the workshop <a href="http://hilda.io/2017/">HILDA 2017</a>, which took place in Chicago at SIGMOD 2017. After graduation I went back to NY to present my thesis at Google (more info <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nycresearchseminar/">here</a>).</p>

<p> Right now I am working on an open-source python library called <a href="https://github.com/nyuvis/partial_dependence">partial_dependence</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://josuakrause.github.io/info/">Josua Krause</a> and <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io/">Enrico Bertini</a>. The purpose of this project is to develop another viz tool using a black box approach to recognize sets of instances where the model makes similar decisions.</p>
