<p>In October 2017 I graduated in my <a href="http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it">master in Data Science</a> in Rome at Sapienza University and my thesis is available <a href="1536242_tamagnini_master_thesis.pdf">here</a>. I was part of the first graduation in Italy for a Data Science degree. The ceremony had many guests from companies like Google, Banca d'Italia, IBM, Microsoft, Unicredit, SAS and Eurostat (more info <a href="http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it/archivionotizie/data-science-first-graduation">here</a>). To celebrate this day I wrote with the other graduating students a <a href="journal.pdf">journal</a> with articles talking about our experiences in the last two years and about the development of our theses.</p>
<p>My theis is realted to a 3-months internship I started in August 2016 in the research team of <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io/">Enrico Bertini</a>, assistant professor at New York University, <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/">Tandon School of Engineering</a>. 
My project was involving the development of a visual analytics tool able to display interactively machine learning explanations. 
I published a paper about this <a href="http://nyuvis-web.poly.edu/projects/rivelo/">project</a> in the workshop <a href="http://hilda.io/2017/">HILDA 2017</a>, which took place in Chicago at SIGMOD 2017.</p>
<p>After graudation I went back to NY to present my thesis at Google (more info <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nycresearchseminar/">here</a>). 
I am looking foward to what might come next, open to any exciting oppurtunities.</p>
