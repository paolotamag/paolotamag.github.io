I recently graduated in my [master in Data Science](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) in Rome at Sapienza University and my thesis is available [here](1536242_tamagnini_master_thesis.pdf). I was part of the first graduation in Italy for a Data Science degree. The ceremony had many guests from companies like Google, Banca d'Italia, IBM, Microsoft, Unicredit, SAS and Eurostat (more info [here](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it/node/5759)). To celebrate this day I wrote with the other graduating students a [journal](journal.pdf) with articles talking about our experiences in the last two years and about the development of our theses.
In August 2016 I started a 3-months internship with [Enrico Bertini](http://enrico.bertini.io/), assistant professor at New York University, [Tandon School of Engineering](http://engineering.nyu.edu/). 
My project was involving the development of a visual analytics tool able to display interactively machine learning explanations. 
On February 2017 I published a paper about my [project](http://nyuvis-web.poly.edu/projects/rivelo/), which has been selected for the workshop [HILDA 2017](http://hilda.io/2017/), which took place in Chicago at SIGMOD 2017 last May.
Now I am back in NY to further develop my research and seize new opportunities.
